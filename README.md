## About Me

I’m currently working on [Bocchi The Game](https://github.com/Yoshiro-FakeCPU/ProjectXYZ) a game of Bocchi The Rock

I’m currently learning Scratch and C##

I love music and often find inspiration from Bocchi the Rock

Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of Steins;Gate, Bocchi the Rock, and the creative community at Scratch Media Lab of MIT
